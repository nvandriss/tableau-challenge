Citi Bike Analysis - January 2022
Total Numbers

The total number of rides per day is reflected in the first line chart. The highest number of rides found was 1,374 on 01/19/22 and the lowest number of rides found was 111 on 01/29/22. This sharp decrease in rides could be due to the snowstorm that took place on January 29th. Of the total number of 26,760 rides, 74.85% were Members while 25.15% were Casual Riders. The number of Casual Riders dropped towards the end of the month, which could be due to the weather during that time.

Most Popular Stations to Start a Trip

The map shows Citi Bike stations by the number of trips started. Each station has been assigned a color. The number of trips are reflected by the size of the marker. The bar chart shows the Top 10 Stations to start a trip. The most popular station to start a trip is the Grove St. PATH station. This is the most popular station because it is located along the Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) transit line. Most of the top stations are located by a transit station making it convenient for people arriving.

Most Popular Stations to End a Trip

The Grove St PATH is also the most popular station to end a trip and the top 4 stations remain the same. More trips end in Hamilton Park than Newport Pkwy. The South Waterfront Walkway is also higher in rank, being the 7th most popular ending station, and the 8th most popular starting station. Additionally the City Hall Station and Hoboken Ave Station make the list of most popular stations to end a trip. Those two stations are in proximity to sights and other landmarks which makes them more ideal points to end a trip rather than start. Lastly, the map indicates that a number of trips end in New York City. More people travel from Jersey City to New York City, than vice versa.
